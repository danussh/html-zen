....................Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2 --> .........................


1.HTTP/2 began as the SPDY protocol, developed primarily at Google with the intention of 
reducing web page load latency by using techniques such as compression, multiplexing, and prioritization
2.reduced latency and accelerates content download on modern web pages.
3. HTTP/2 uses the binary framing layer to encapsulate all messages in binary format

1.In this process, a client sends a text-based request to a server by calling a method like GET or POST.
 In response, the server sends a resource like an HTML page back to the client.
2.increased latency and delay in loading modern web pages.
3.HTTP/1.1, which keeps all requests and responses in plain text format


..............................Abstract Working of JS engine(V8) --> ......................


1.It all starts with getting JavaScript code from the network.
2.when java scriptcode passes through V8 parser the source code  turns it into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
Based on that AST, conversion of machine code
3.At that point, the engine starts running the code and collecting feedback.
4.then the machine code runs in processorand we get the output. 

................List 5 difference between Browser JS(console) vs Nodejs -->.................. 

Browser js
1.executes javascript
2.It is provided in script tag with src as filename.js
3.bit difficult to program in browser comared to node js
4.interacting with DOM or other web platforms like API
5.we wont get luxuary to choose what browser we will use

Node js
1.executes javascript
2.It is provided as node filename.js
3.comfort of programing is an added advantage
4.no interaction with DOM or other web platforms like API
5.control the enviorment

..............what happens when you type a URL in the address bar in the browser?.................


1.You enter a URL into a web browser
2.The browser looks up the IP address for the domain name via DNS and matches it
3.The browser sends a HTTP request to the server
4.The server sends back a HTTP response
5.The browser begins rendering the HTML
6.The browser sends requests for additional objects embedded in HTML (images, css, JavaScript) and repeats steps 3-5.
7.Once the page is loaded, the browser sends further async requests as needed.

...................................http version history...........................................

1.HTTP/0.9 — The One-line Protocol
   Initial version of HTTP — a simple client-server, request-response,
   Methods supported: GET only
   Connection nature: terminated immediately after the response
    No HTTP headers, No status/error codes, No URLs

2.HTTP/1.0 — Building extensibility
   Browser-friendly protocol
   Provided header fields including both request and response 
   Methods supported: GET , HEAD , POST
   Connection nature: terminated immediately after the response
3.HTTP/1.1 — The standardized protocol
  This is the HTTP version currently in common use.
   Methods supported: GET , HEAD , POST , PUT , DELETE , TRACE , OPTIONS
    Connection nature: long-lived
   faster response and great bandwidth savings by adding cache support.
3.HTTP/2
  HTTP/2 was derived from the earlier experimental SPDY protocol, developed by Google. It made web applications faster, simpler, and more robust.
  But in HTTP/2, the header fields are compressed and transmitted in binary codes making it more compact and efficient for the user computer to load.
  Header compression decreases the overhead of client request which lowers bandwidth and decreases page load time.
  Multiplexing multiple requests over a single TCP connection
