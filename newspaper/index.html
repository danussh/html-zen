                <p>By 2025, India aims to become an EV manufacturing hub As per the announcement by the Union Minister for Road Transport and Highways Nitin Gadkari, the electric vehicles and biofuels have an excellent chance for mass adoption. The EV industry’s hope for the promotion at the governmental level has gone up. Gadkari said India is likely to become EV manufacturing Hub By 2025. Since he also said the Government was also extending all the support it possibly can to the EV industry, it may catalyse the auto sector’s growth. Gadkari also announced that the government is currently working on what will be its first electric highway that will be part of the soon-to-be-ready Delhi-Mumbai Green Corridor.<br>
