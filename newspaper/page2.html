                    A student has approached the Delhi High Court alleging
                    that a government school
                    had denied admission to him
                    on grounds of his age being
                    higher than the
                    requirement.
                    Shekh Habibul, who is 18­
                    and­a­half years old, said he
                    was forced to leave his private school due to financial
                    constraints during the pandemic. He was studying in 10th.<br>
                    K.D. Model School at Bawana
                    Road in Barwala since Class
                    II. He passed his Class X
                    CBSE examinations earlier
                    this year.
                    Shekh said his family suffered a major financial loss
                    after the COVID­19 outbreak
                    and could not pay his school fees. <br>The petition, filed through
                    advocate Ashok Agarwal,
                    stated that Habibul has been
                    trying to get admission in Government Sarvodaya Bal Vidyalaya, Prahalad Pur in Delhi, under non­plan
                    admission since the first
                    week of September. <br>Mr. Aggarwal said the student had visited school several times and also applied
                    for admission in Class XI
                    through online mode under
                    non­plan admission for academic session 2020­21,
                    which was not accepted on
                    the website. <br>
                    The victim, Manish Yadav, was found unconscious in the buildingwhere he lives with his family on rent. His family
                    alleged that he was beaten to death. “We have
                    registered an FIR.  The
                    post­mortem report is
                    awaited,” said an officer.

                   <p> Mr. Aggarwal stated that
                    the government has issued a
                    laid down is not applicable
                    to plan admissions i.e. the
                    existing students of government schools.
                    The plea contended that
                    there is no justification on
                    the part of the government
                    school to deny admission to
                    Habibul on grounds of his
                    age. The plea stated that Habibul has no gap in his studies and him coming from a
                    private school to a government school cannot be a
                    ground for differentiation.

                    seeking direct admission, in
                    all classes upto to Class XII
                    for the academic session
                    20-20­21.<br> The circular provides that
                    only those students will be
                    granted direct admission in

                    years of age but are less than
                    17 years.
                    The circular further provides that the age criteria laid down is not applicable
                    to plan admissions i.e. the
                    existing students of government schools.<br>
                    The plea contended that

                    school to deny admission to
